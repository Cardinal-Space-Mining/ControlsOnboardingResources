# ControlsOnboardingResources
Projects for new CSMC controls members to learn basic code fundamentals that will help with club projects.

### Languages
As a controls team, we primarily use `C++` in our systems. Since we are using `ROS` we can use Python with C++/C languages. But, for the sakes of simplicity we would like to **only** be using C++. You _do not need to know_ C++ to be a member of the controls team. This will provide you an opportunity to learn C++ before you may take a class and get a more beneficial/usable experience with C++ than you will in classes. Have fun!
