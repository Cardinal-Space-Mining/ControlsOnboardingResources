# Hello World ROS Demo
In this demo example, you will make 2 ROS nodes that will send a Hello World message between them. This will be similar to the Talk/Listen except with your OWN code.

**The `src` directory is the solution. We encourage you follow along with the steps provided**

## Setup
1. To start ROS program, create a new directory: `mkdir demo1_ws` then enter workspace with `cd demo1_ws`
2. Create a `src` directory inside `demo1_ws` using `mkdir src`
3. To create the ROS program run `colcon build`. This command will create the ROS program, since the project is empty **0 packages finished** should be the result of running this command.

## Run new ROS program DEMO_1
