# Fuzzyball - Autonomated
In this demo, you will create a ROS program to control the test chassis/robot autonomously. This demo is a much more basic version of how our competition robot will function. In Lunabotics, you can score more points for your robot running autonomously using many sensors including lidar and cameras. We will not include these into the demo as they can be complicated and can be fragile/expensive.

The premise of the demo is for the chassis/robot to navigate a predefined course/objectives autonomously. As we do not have a predesigned course, there will **not** be a solution, but instead you will be provided a template to complete this challenge. This will provide a real sense of how we work designing and programming our package for competition.
