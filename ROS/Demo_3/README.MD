# Fuzzyball - Teleoperated
In this demo, you will create a ROS program to control the test chassis/robot with a controller. In standard practice for our club, we will use a Logitch controller. This form of control is called Teleoperated or Teleop for short. In the Lunabotics competition we are allowed to control our robot with this system. Although we will lose points for this.

There will **not** be a solution, but instead you will be provided a template to complete this challenge. This will provide a real sense of how we work designing and programming our package for competition.
