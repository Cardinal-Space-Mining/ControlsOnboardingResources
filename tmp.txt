Mike,

No problem.

• When you mention creating wireless networks, are you planning to supply and configure the wireless APs yourself, including setting up the SSIDs for device connectivity?
	* The competing teams will each bring their own AP that will be used to connect their laptops to their robots.
• Will these wireless networks be isolated, allowing only communication between connected devices, or will they require access to the public internet or other university resources?
	* These wireless networks will be isolated from the ISU network.
• How long do you expect these wireless networks to be operational?
	* Around 3 days where up to 20 teams are running their own AP for up to 10 hours a day.
• Will these wireless networks be secured (requiring a password) or open?
	* Dependent on the team that competes. 


Thanks,
Jacob
